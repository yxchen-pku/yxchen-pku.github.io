I am a PhD student in the School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University, supervised by Zhifei Zhang and Shengquan Xiang. My current research focuses on the ergodicity and large deviation principle of randomly forced dispersive PDEs.

**Infinite-dimensional Random Dynamical Systems**  
Ergodicity theory is concerned with the uniqueness of the invariant measure and its mixing properties. Heuristically, the mechanism for unique ergodicity is the balance between randomness (spreading out trajectories) and dissipation (concentrating to the origin). In infinite-dimensional spaces, lack of compactness presents a core obstacle. Inspired by attractor in dynamical systems, we exploit the concept of 'asymptotic tightness' to establish general criteria for mixing and large deviations.

**Hyperbolic and Dispersive PDEs**  
We investigate nonlinear wave, Schrödinger and KdV equations, and identify the correspondence between the hypotheses of the abstract mixing criterion and the properties of deterministic PDEs: asymptotic compactness ⟷ nonlinear smoothing; irreducibility ⟷ global stability; Feller-type property ⟷ control theory. A bunch of analytical tools then come into play, including harmonic analysis, Carleman-type estimates, microlocal analysis and Bourgain spaces.

**Interaction Between Mathematical Branches**  
It seems unlikely that I will study interdisciplinarity in the near future. But, in my opinion, this is always the source of the best mathematics. Here are some of my favourites, though I cannot fully understand any of them: Weil's conjecture ('Riemann's conjecture on finite fields'), the Atiyah–Singer index theorem (the Fredholm index of an elliptic pseudodifferential operator from a cohomology viewpoint) and algebraic quantum unique ergodicity (the delocalisation of Laplace eigenfunctions on algebraic hyperbolic surfaces).
