I am a PhD student in the School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University, under the supervision of Zhifei Zhang and Shengquan Xiang. My research now focuses on the ergodicity and large deviation principle of randomly forced dispersive PDEs.

Infinite-dimensional Random Dynamical Systems
-----
The ergodicity theory is concerned with the uniqueness of invariant measure and its mixing properties. Heuristically, the machanisim for unique ergodicity is the balance between randomness (spreading out trajectories) and dissipation (concentrating to origin). In infinite-dimensional spaces, the lack of compactness manifests a core obstacle. Inspired by the notion of attractor from dynamical systems, we exploit the concept of "asymsptotic tightness" to establish general criteria for mixing and large deviations.

Hyperbolic and dispersive PDEs
-----
We identify the correspondence between hypotheses in the abstrate mixing criterion and properties of diterminisitic PDEs:  
Asymptotic compactness ⟷ Nonlinear smoothing  
Irreducibility ⟷ Global stability  
Feller-type property ⟷ Control theory  
A bunch of analitical tools then comes into play: harmonic analysis, Carleman-type estimates, microlocal analysis, Bourgain spaces......

Interaction between math branches
-----
It seems unlikely that I will actually study interdisciplinary in a short time. But from my perspective this is always the sourse of best mathematics. Here are some of my favorate, though none of them can be fully understood by me: Weil's conjecture ("Riemann's conjecture on finite fields"), Atiyah—Singer index theorem (Fredholm index of elliptic peudodifferential operator from the cohomology viewpoint), algebraic quantum unique ergodicity (delocalization of Laplace eigenfunctions on algebraic hyperbolic surfaces).
